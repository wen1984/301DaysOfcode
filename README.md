> Beacuse it is a pretreatment,need use sass syntax the code written is converted basic css.
>
> it is easy read the code.

#### Store Data with Sass Variables
> Different is it use variable,like same JavaScript.
>
> it use _$_ variable.

## 24 July 2019
> 2 round 2 Days
>
> Freecodecam learn React challenges.
>
> React is Facebook promotion,it is a use building user interface open source JavaScript Libray.
>
> React combine HTML with JavaScript functionality to create your own markup language JSX.
>
#### Create a smiple JSX Element
> React use name:point_right:JSX the JavaScript syntax expand.
> it allows you to write HTML directly in JavaScript.
>
> :point_right:can in hte JSX directly JavaScript,only need to write _**{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }**_
>
#### Practice:
> const JSX = <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello JSX!&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
> // Output
> <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>
>
#### Create a Complex JSX Element
> JSX it is can to write smiple and to write complex the HTML.
>
> Valid JSX:
> <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
>   &lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
> &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
>
> Invalid JSX:
> <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

-------------------------
## 25 July 2019
> 2 round 3 Days
>
#### Add Comments in JSX
> It must in the JSX place comments,can use syntax {/* */}
>

#### Render HTML Element to the DOM
> Exaple:
> _**ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)**_
> First parameter is want rendering a React element or component.
>
> The second parameter is the DOM node to which the component is to be presented.
>
> Use _**ReactDOM.render()**_

#### Define an HTML class in JSX
> Keyword different is can't use this word _class_ to definition HTML class.
>
> JSX use _**className**_
>
> JSX all the HTML attributes and anything the naming convention of the reference has become _**cameICase**_.
>
#### Learn About self-closing JSX tags
> JSX with HTML another important way is Autistic label.
>
> If can to write&lt;br&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;,never write&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;it doesn't contain any content.
>
> Today I'm watch the Youtube about how to use HTML&CSS build Web [Build Tabs Using HTML/CSS In only 12 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L6h_MrNvsk)
>
> I wish can learn about HTML&CSS and JavaScript how to build smiple the web and let me understand how to use any tool can help me.:blush:

=========================
## 27-28 July 2019
> 2 round 5-6 Days
>
> 27 July didn't learn and get new computer
>
> 28 July afternoon start to watching Youtube learn [**CSS 3D Filp Button Hover Effects**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFfvXFQV9Lo&t=4s) and [**HTML Tutorial - How to Make a Super Simple Website**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlxWf493en4&t=901s)
>
> It is easy learn make sure you can know correct concept and must spur myself.
> 
#### React: Create a Stateless Functional Component
> The component is the core of React,All content is a component,learning how to create a conponent.
>
> Beacuse JSX conponent representative the HTML,so can put several components together to create more complex HTML pages.
>
##### Practice
> <pre><code>const MyComponet = function() {
>       return (
>          &lt;div&gt;Complete challenge!&lt;/div&gt;
>       );
> }</code></pre>
>
#### React: Create a React Componet
> React component another way is use **ES6** class sytnax.
>
> parent class smiple function _React.Component_
>
> smiple function is use class keyword create the special method used during the initialization of the created object.
>
#### React: Create a Component with Composition
> How combination a lot of React component.
> 
> If you in the simple a application,and simple three component _Navbar_ , _Dashboard_ and _Footer_.
>
##### Example:
> <pre><code>return (
> &lt;App&gt;
>     &lt;Navbar /&gt;
>     &lt;Dashboard /&gt;
>     &lt;Footer /&gt;
> &lt;/App&gt;
> )</code></pre>
>
#### React: Use React to Render Nested Components
> Many different way can use React combination component.
>
> it smiplefies the development and maintenance of complex projects.

#### React: Compose Reacts Components
>
##### _**Note:**_ in the presenting ES6-Style components in other components no different than rendering the simplicity you are using.
##### You can render JSX elements,stateless functional components,and ES6 class components in other components.
>
#### React: Render a Class Component to the DOM
>
> This is sytnax practice, **ReactDOM.render (componentToRender, targetNode)
>
> First parameter is presenting React components,Second parameter is in other presenting components DOM node.
>
> The React component's pass to **ReactDOM.render()** is slightly different from the JSX element.
>
> You need use and rendering nest components time same sytnax **<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(&lt;ComponentToRender /&gt;, targetNode)</code></pre>**
>
#### React: write a React Component from Scratch
> 
> The React component is React application core building block,Because often familiar with writeing them is very important.
>
> **PLEASE REMEMBER** React component is class expansion ES6 _React.Component_
>
> It is have a return HTML (from _JSX_) or null.This is React component the basic style.

##### Keep learn and every thing make sure myself can know use correct.:raised_hands:

=========================== 
## 31 July 2019
> 2R9Day
>
#### React: Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component
>
> Another feature common in React: props
>
> In the React,you can pass props or properties to child components.
>
> Example:
> <pre><code>const Welcome = (props) => &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.user}!&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
>
> Calling this value is a standard props. When dealing with stateless function components, you basically think of it as a parameter that returns a function of JSX.
>
#### React: Pass an Array as Props
>
> How to pass an array props,to pass an array to a JSX element,you must treat it as JavaScript and use braces.
> <pre><code>&lt;ParentComponent&gt;
>    &lt;ChildComponent color={["green", "blue", "red"]} /&gt;
> &lt;/ParentComponent&gt;</code></pre>
>
> Child component can access to the properties colors, join() can use the array method when accessing properties.
>
> <pre><code>const ChildComponent = (props) => &lt;p&gt;{props.colors.join(', ')}&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
>
#### React: Use Default Props
>
> React also has an option to set default items.You can assign the default item to the component as a property of the component itself,and if necessary,React will assign the default piller.
>
> Example:
> <pre><code>MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' }</code></pre>
>
> Practice:
> <pre><code>const ShoppingCart = (props) => {
>     return (
>     &lt;div&gt;
>   &lt;h1&gt;Shopping Cart Component&lt;/h1&gt;
>     &lt;/div&gt;
>     )
> };
> ShoppingCart.defaultProps = { items: 0 }</code></pre>

#### React: Override Default Props
>
> The ability to set default items is a usefull feature in React.
>
> The way to override the default item is to explicitly set the component's Prop value.
>
> <pre><code>&lt;Component propsName = {Value} /&gt;</code></pre>
>
> Example:
> <pre><code>&lt;Items quantity = {50} /&gt;</code></pre>
>
#### React: Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect
>
> React provides a useful type checking feature to verify that the component received the correct type of item.
>
> To set propTypes,the syntax to follow is:
> <pre><code>itemName.propTypes = {
>   props: PropTypes.dataType.isRequired
> };</code></pre>
>
#### React: Access Props Using this.props
>
> Whenever you refer to class component yourself,use the "this" keyword.
>
> To access the props in the class component,add the code "this" to access it.
>
> Example,if ES6 class component have a called prop "data",then {this.props.data} in the JSX.

#### React: Review Using Props with Stateless Functional
>
> A common pattern is to minimize statefulness and create stateless functional components.Helps stats management to be included in psecific areas of the application.
>
#### React:　Create a Stateful Component
>
> One of the most important topics of React is that state.
>
> State contains what data application needs to know,which may change over time.
>
> The state property must be set to JavaScript object.
> Example: 
> <pre><code>this.state = {
> // describe your state here
> }</code></pre>
>
> *Note:* _You must create the class component by extending the **React.Component** so that the state is created like this._
>
> 6 August 2019
>
#### React: Render State in the User Interface
>
#### React: Render State in the User Interface Another Way
>
#### React: Set State with this.setState
>
> Like this:
> <pre><code>this.setState ({
>   username: 'Lewis'
> });</code></pre>
>
> The React hope that you will never modify it,but always **this.setState()** in used when the state change.

========================
## 7 August 2019

> 2R16Day
>
#### React: Bind 'this' to a class Method
>
> A common approach is to explicitly bind **this** in the constructor so that this binds the class when the component is initialized.
>
> You may have noticed that **this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)** in the constructor is used for its **handleClick** method.
>
#### React: Use State to Toggle an Element
>
> You can use them in the React application in a more complex way than you have seen so far.
> 
> _Bind **this** to the method constructor._
>
> <pre><code>this.toggleVisibility = thsi.toggleVisibility.bind(this)</code></pre>

#### React: Create a Controlled Input
#### React: Create a Controlled Form
#### React: Pass State as Props to Child Components
>
> This three lesson I'm think them can use **input** and **textarea,** **state** and **form**
>
> React can controlled some element internal state,example "input" and "textarea",this use it become controlled component,this also applies to other form element,including regular HTML _form_ elements.
>
> A common mode is let a contain *state* the important application stateful component.
