#### React: Compose Reacts Components
>
##### _**Note:**_ in the presenting ES6-Style components in other components no different than rendering the simplicity you are using.
##### You can render JSX elements,stateless functional components,and ES6 class components in other components.
>
#### React: Render a Class Component to the DOM
>
> This is sytnax practice, **ReactDOM.render (componentToRender, targetNode)
>
> First parameter is presenting React components,Second parameter is in other presenting components DOM node.
>
> The React component's pass to **ReactDOM.render()** is slightly different from the JSX element.
>
> You need use and rendering nest components time same sytnax **<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(&lt;ComponentToRender /&gt;, targetNode)</code></pre>**
>
#### React: write a React Component from Scratch
> 
> The React component is React application core building block,Because often familiar with writeing them is very important.
>
> **PLEASE REMEMBER** React component is class expansion ES6 _React.Component_
>
> It is have a return HTML (from _JSX_) or null.This is React component the basic style.
